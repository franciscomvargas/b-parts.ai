# B-Parts AI assistent
Developing an AI assistant dedicated to motorized vehicles using Django.

## ðŸ§  1st Brainstorm

1. **Setting up Django**: Create a new Django project using the command:
    ```
    django-admin startproject bparts_assistant
    ```

2. **Create Django App**: You should create a Django app within your project to contain the logic related to the AI assistant. You can do this using the command:
    ```
    python manage.py startapp assistant_app
    ```

3. **Integrate OpenAI API**: You can start by integrating the OpenAI API within your Django app to enable the AI capabilities. Check [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) to understand how to make API requests and handle responses.

4. **Design Database Models**: Consider creating Django models to store data related to motorized vehicles, user interactions, and any other relevant information needed for the assistant.

5. **Implement Views and Templates**: Create views that interact with the OpenAI API and serve the appropriate responses to users. Design templates to display the AI assistant's responses on the front end.

6. **Set Up User Authentication**: If you want to enable user-specific features or save user preferences.
